 DataBuilder app README
 **********************

 This application is the graphical frontend to building data models for
 the GNUstep Core Data framework in a simple click'n'click fashion. It
 resembles, to some degree, the data modelling tool of Apple's Xcode
 IDE, but does not mimic it's behavior. Rather it tries to follow the
 good old OpenStep fashion of using separate apps for separate purposes
 (that's why it's not included as part of some IDE, but is instead a
 stand-alone app).


 INSTALLATION
 ------------

 You must install the GNUstep Core Data framework
 (http://gscoredata.nongnu.org) and all it's associated dependencies
 first in order to compile and use DataBuilder. After that it should
 be as simple as:

 $ make
 $ make install      <- may require superuser priviledges
