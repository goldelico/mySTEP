 GNUstep CoreData Model File Format

 The default extension to use for archived contents of
 NSManagedObjectModel in the GNUstep Core Data framework should be
 "gsdatamodel". The format can be found in NSManagedObjectModel.m,
 namely in the implementation of the methods
 [NSManagedObjectModel-encodeWithCoder:] and
 [NSManagedObjectModel-initWithCoder:].

 By default, you should use keyed archives (as that is what the methods
 for explicit loading of data models from files expect).
